        <h3>Why Choose TWANG?</h3>&nbsp;
		
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past two decades, social media has made a huge impact on society, including our youth. Today young children ranging from ages 11-18 are actively on adult centered platforms. These platforms have been known to play a negative role on their mental health, self-esteem, and academic performance.</p>
        
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here at TWANG, we've created a solution that serves children for the better. By creating a separate space where children can engage with one another in a secured environment. We've formulated the perfect platform where our youth can finally thrive. With the help of an A.I. assisted planner, students are able to keep track of their curriculum and find innovative ways to study and increase classroom engagement.<p>
       
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only is TWANG providing a safe place for children to engage & improve their academics, we've taken it a step further by providing additional resources that is useful to each child no matter their interest and academic journey. Providing resources for their local community with opportunities to volunteer, seek local jobs, or apply for scholarships for college.</p>
